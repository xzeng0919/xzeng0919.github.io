== Research Interest
I am a Ph.D. student working under the advisement of [https://www.hgc.jp/~knakai/ Prof. Kenta Nakai] at the Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo. My research focuses on spatial transcriptomics, gene regulatory network analysis and brain evolution, using /Ciona intestinalis/ as a model organism. I have a broad interest in applying machine learning methods in next-generation sequencing data to elucidate the complex biological questions!

== Apart From Research

- Stargazing, I love watching stars both via eyes and telescopes.
- Photography, I like stree photography and landscape photography. You can see my photos in [https://www.instagram.com/wxcjl0919/ Instagram]
- Hiking, I like hiking with my friends!
